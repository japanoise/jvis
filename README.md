# jvis - json visualiser

Quick and dirty json visualiser. Up and down moves through the current node,
right goes in deeper, left goes up a level; vi and emacs keys work. You can also
search with `C-s`, `/` or `n` and search backward with `C-r`, `?` or `p`. Quit
with `q` or `C-c`. EOF with `M->` or `G`, BOF with `M-<` or `g`.
